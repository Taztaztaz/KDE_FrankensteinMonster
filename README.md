# Migrate
Linux script to save current OS config and some files migrate to new OS 

Distrohoppers dream or old man savior.

It should be abel to save your chosen configs and files and reload/save them to new OS and also be simple.
Maybe someday even cross DE.

It's still in vision state currently, until I learn enough or sombody helps a lot :D
